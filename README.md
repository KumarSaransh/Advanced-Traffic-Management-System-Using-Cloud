# Advanced-Traffic-Management-System-Using-Cloud
This is My Minor Project in B.Tech

The primary objective of the project is to enhance the functionality of the trafficmanagement system by employing Internet of Things (IoT) and infrared sensor technology, thereby ensuring greater efficiency in traffic flow. Existing traffic management automationsystems typically rely on periodic operations to control traffic lights, utilizing technologiessuch as GSM and NFC to manage the basic switching between red and green lights. Our project aims to introduce an automated solution based on IR sensors, enablingtraffic signals to adjust dynamically between red and green lights. Initially, we plantoimplement this solution at a single junction as a 'proof-of-concept.' This implementationwill involve the integration of traffic lights, IR sensors, a Wi-Fi transmitter, andanArduino micro-controller. The IR sensor data will be collected and transmittedviatheWi-Fi transmitter to the Arduino controller. Using this data, the systemwill dynamicallyadjust the timing of red signals, providing users with real-time updates on signal status. The Arduino controller will serve as a central console, determining the openingandclosing of road signals. Additionally, it will aggregate sensor data and store it inthecloud, enabling mobile devices to access real-time traffic status updates and facilitatingprioritypassage for emergency vehicles such as ambulances.
